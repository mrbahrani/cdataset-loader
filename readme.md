### What is CDataLoader?

In recent years, an increasing number of developers have chosen to use C and C++ for their deep learning tasks. While these languages offer performance advantages and low-level control, they lack the convenient data-loading interfaces provided by frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. These frameworks make it incredibly simple to load data into memory and prepare it for training, but achieving similar functionality in C or C++ can be a daunting challenge.

CDataLoader is a library designed to address this gap. Its primary goal is to make data loading in C and C++ as seamless and intuitive as possible. With CDataLoader, developers can focus on building and optimizing their models without worrying about the initial format of their data or the complexities of downloading datasets. This library handles these tasks efficiently, providing a user-friendly interface that simplifies the workflow and accelerates development.

Whether you're working with images, text, or any other type of data, CDataLoader aims to make your experience smoother and more productive. By integrating this library into your project, you can enjoy the performance benefits of C/C++ without compromising on ease of use.
